Longest Common Substring Java Implementation Using Ukkonen's Algorithm

I ultimately designed my own classes for this problem. However, for building the tree itself, I referenced these following pages for the logic:
* [Suffix Tree Application 5 - Longest Common Substring GeeksforGeeks](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/suffix-tree-application-5-longest-common-substring-2/)
* [Ukkonen's Suffix Tree in Plain English](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9452701/ukkonens-suffix-tree-algorithm-in-plain-english/9513423#9513423)
